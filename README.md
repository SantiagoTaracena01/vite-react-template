# Vite + React Template

#### Introduction

This is a template for projects that use Vite, React and Sass. In this case, Vite is a tool used
to bundle a project into a couple of files that can easily be deployed into the Internet. React
is a library that allows to develop using the famous .jsx syntax, that makes component-oriented
development easy. Finally, Sass is a CSS preprocessor with an amazing and clean syntax to read
and use while developing styles.

#### Install

The only thing you need to do in order to install this template is to clone this repository.
Go to the directory where you want to create a Vite + React app, and then execute the following
command in a terminal.

`git clone https://github.com/SantiagoTaracena01/vite-react-template`

This will clone this repository into your computer. My personal recommendation would be to rename
the directory and give it the name of the project you're gonna work on.
